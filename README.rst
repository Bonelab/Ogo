Overview
========

This repository contains command-line applications developed for performing bone health analysis from computed tomography images.

It includes tools for segmentation, calibration, image manipulation, segmentation validation
and quantitative analysis. It is expected that the data format is NIfTI, so DICOM files should
be converted using a trusted tool (we recommend https://github.com/dgobbi/vtk-dicom). It is 
also helpful to integrate this with the free finite element analysis FAIM tool, developed
in the Bone Imaging Laboratory (https://bonelab.github.io/n88/faim.html).

A key function of Ogo is quantitative calibration of CT data, including internal calibration,
which was presented at the ASBMR in 2018 and published in 2020:

Install
=======

.. code-block:: bash

    # Clone the repository onto your computer and change into the directory.
    # ... with SSH authentication
    git clone git@github.com:Bonelab/Ogo.git
    # ... or straight HTTPS
    git clone https://github.com/Bonelab/Ogo.git

    # It is recommended to create a virtual environment using conda:
    conda create -n ogo -c numerics88 -c conda-forge pandas nibabel pyyaml python=3
    
    # Activate your conda environment, make sure you have conda installed on your system.
    # Best way to install conda is through anaconda
    conda activate ogo
    
    # Install in an 'editable' format 
    pip install -e .

    # You can also run the full install
    python setup.py install


Utilities
=========

ogo.util
----------

:code:`ogo.util.echo_arguments`

- utility function to use with a command-line application, or a function, to automatically print the arguments to the terminal

:code:`ogo.util.Helper`

- numerous helper functions for tasks in the command line functions (many of these are legacy and not used anymore)

:code:`ogo.util.write_csv`

- utility function for writing data stored in a dictionary to a csv file

:code:`ogo.util.graphcuts`

- place holder for installing software for ogoGraphCuts. Read OGO_GRAPHCUTS_INSTALL.txt

ogo.dat
----------

:code:`ogo.dat.OgoMasterLabels`

- a dictionary of labels used by many of the command line interface functions. Any new labels must be defined here. Use ogoPrintLabels to output the dictionary.

:code:`ogo.dat.MassAttenuationTables`

- the NIST table of mass attenuation versus energy levels used for internal calibration.

:code:`ogo.dat.RT_FEMUR_SIDEWAYS_FALL_REF`

- the reference polygon data for alignment prior to finite element analysis.

:code:`ogo.dat.LT_FEMUR_SIDEWAYS_FALL_REF`

- the reference polygon data for alignment prior to finite element analysis.

:code:`ogo.dat.L4_BODY_SPINE_COMPRESSION_REF`

- the reference polygon data for alignment prior to finite element analysis.

ogo.calib
----------

The calibration functionality is templated as described below and is best accessed using CLI :code:`ogoImageCalibration`

:code:`ogo.calib.calibration`

- top class for all types of calibration

:code:`ogo.calib.standard_calibration`

- inherits from :code:`calibration` and implements basic commands

:code:`ogo.calib.internal_calibration`

- function for performing internal calibration; inherits from :code:`standard_calibration` and :code:`calibration`

:code:`ogo.calib.mindways_calibration`

- function for performing phantom calibration; inherits from :code:`standard_calibration` and :code:`calibration`

Command Line Apps
=================

Here is a list of all of the command-line apps that get installed along with the ogo package.
For detailed usage instructions, type the command followed by :code:`-h` into the terminal
with the :code:`ogo` environment activated.

Developer Notes
===============

Style Guide Enforcement
-----------------------
`flake8` is used for style guide enforcement. You will not be able to merge without passing the style guide.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ogo
    flake8

Running Tests
-------------
`nose` is used for running tests. You will not be able to merge without your tests passing. And please, do write tests.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd Ogo  # From root directory, not ogo
    nosetests

Building Docs Locally
---------------------
Use `sphinx-build`. This should rather fast.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd Ogo  # From root directory, not ogo
    sphinx-build docs/ docs/_build/html/
