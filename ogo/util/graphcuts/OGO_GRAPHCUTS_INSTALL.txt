The graph cuts method was developed by others and here we only provide an 
implementation for our own use in a convenient manner that integrates with our 
work flow.

Installation instructions:

In preparation, you will need CMAKE (https://cmake.org) at least version 3.xx. 
Download it and install it on your computer. Alternatively, you can install it 
using anaconda.

$ conda create -n cmake -c conda-forge cmake=3
$ conda activate cmake
$ ccmake --version
  ccmake version 3.25.1

The installation will occur in the GIT repository under ogo/util/graphcuts. The
full path might be (fix accordingly):

$ export GRAPHCUTS=/Users/username/Ogo/ogo/util/graphcuts

Graph cuts software requires ITK to be installed. This must be downloaded and 
built from source.

$ cd $GRAPHCUTS
$ git clone https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK.git
$ cd ITK
$ git checkout v5.2.0
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

Download the graph cuts code here: https://gridcut.com/downloads.php. Unpack the 
GridCut-1.3.zip file and move its contents into a sub directory 
$GRAPHCUTS/lib/gridcut

$ mkdir -p $GRAPHCUTS/lib/gridcut 
$ cd $GRAPHCUTS/lib/gridcut
$ cp ~/Downloads/GridCut-1.3.zip .
$ unzip GridCut-1.3.zip
$ rm GridCut-1.3.zip
  
You are now ready to build the applications necessary for graph cuts. Create a 
build directory and perform the build.

$ mkdir -p $GRAPHCUTS/build
$ cd $GRAPHCUTS/build
$ ccmake ..

CMake will not find the ITK library and needs the installation directory to be
defined:

ITK_DIR=$GRAPHCUTS/ITK/build
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$GRAPHCUTS

Once CMake has accepted the changes and you select 'c'for 'configure' followed 
by 'g' for 'generate', at the command line type:

$ make
$ make install

The project should be built successfully now. The binaries will be located in
$GRAPHCUTS/bin and can be left in that directory or moved to a directory of your
choice.
